Guessing Game Project for class SPEA-BL-MSCH-C220-10566
It is my first project in my game technology class, a number guessing game that runs in python. Basically tells the player the range of numbers to guess from, then depending on the response it will let the player know to either guess higher or lower. Once number is guessed it tells the player how many times it took to guess the number, then whether they'd like to play the game again.
